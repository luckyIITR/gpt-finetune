It's not like you can switch to a different company if you aren't happy with their shit service. Another thing is that the capacity for fast internet exists it's just that they have no reason to give it to you. My city recently became a prospective city for google fiber and TWC immediately upgraded our 20mb/s connection (maximum available) to 100mb/s for free and also started offering 200mb/s and 300mb/s for not much extra. They're also doing everything they can lawsuit wise to keep google fiber out of the city\",\n",

Though, I'm on their Wi-Fi as [it's much faster]( URL_0 ) (he's an exec at HP so gotta have fast Internet). 90% of the answer is because they can. 10% of the answer is because money, America is huge, and dense, so having to have thousands/millions of cell towers spread across the country and having hundreds in a single city is expensive in regards to renting out the land, supplying enough data per tower, etc.\",\n",
       "  \"Of all of the countries to use as an example, you use Australia? They still have a good chunk of the country on dialup since it's such a large region but has only six or so metropolitan areas. Really, America's internet speeds aren't that bad. They're not #1 but I think they were in the top 10. Meanwhile, Australia is still trying to build a fiber network but its own government keeps sabotaging it\",\n",
       "  \"Several reasons: 1. there's little or no competition in most markets. 2. the cost of starting up puts it out of reach for most companies. Even Google is growing insanely slow due to the cost of laying new lines 3. we've got other problems. My Internet is reliable (like 95%+ uptime) and fast enough (50 Mb) for just about anything my family of 4 needs for $65 a month. The only way things are going to change is if we make a widespread political effort to change it and frankly, my efforts there are better spent on other issues.\",\n",
       "  \"Speeds are so slow because the telecom industry in America is a monopoly. In certain areas you only have one choice for a provider, so why would they spend money to improve their services if you don't have any other choice? The telecom industry has been vigorously lobbying and filing lawsuits to prevent competition. Things like poles, switches, and boxes (the kind you find outside) are owned and rented out. Lawsuits have been thrown around to prevent other companies from using those utilities which makes it hard to compete. Telecom companies also sign deals with the cities themselves. If the city attempts to provide their own internet they would get sued. The only reason Google Fiber was able to become a thing is because Google could afford to build their own utilities and fight in court with a chance of winning. The American telecom industry is the poster child of corruption and bad morals and ethics. They are not satisfied with their 97% profit margins and don't care one bit about making the world a better, more connected place. It is because of Google Fiber that companies like Comcast are finally starting to improve their networks, because it is clear to both sides that the moment Google Fiber is available everybody will jump ship. These companies are fully aware of what they are doing and how damaging they are and are terrified that their monopoly will end.\",\n",
       "  \"Most people here simply do not understand how absurdly expensive running fiber is here in the US. A lot of it is all the codes and standards, environmental protections etc. Just to give you an example. When we tried to build a single fiber run to a local school, the cost was $75,000. We got an estimate for wiring the entire small city for fiber (every home) and it came out to about $35 million. That's for about 15,000 people. That's almost $2400 per person if every single one of those 15,000 signs up. That's just the fiber and equipment, no bandwidth to backhaul providers, etc. And this involves no big greedy corporations who just want to charge you a ton of money because they are evil and diabolical as is the common belief on Reddit. And in the real world, this notion that bandwidth costs nothing is simply untrue. Sure there are some companies that trade bandwidth. So long as they are both sending each other the same amount of data each way, they don't charge each other for that mutual bandwidth. But its not very common for ISPs. The US is very vast and has lot of mountains in many areas. Those long distances cost a huge amount of money to cover, as do areas like mountains. So take the endless claims that it's all about big greedy corporations with a grain of salt. Feel free to do some research and see how much it would cost you if you were to build your own fiber network non-profit and you will see for yourself.\",\n",
       "  \"You won't get 200Mbps on Telstra LTE most of the time unless you're very lucky. First of all, the guy is in Melbourne, speedtesting to a Telstra server. Telstra has its HQ in Melbourne, and they have very strong mobile reception here (plus in other cities). But outside of the bigger cities, or even in the suburbs, the mobile cells are further spaced out, so there's more congestion and generally the speeds drop off a bit. It is pretty good though, I'm currently getting 85Mbps inside my house (Melbourne suburbs, about 8km from the CBD). Telstra is a world leader in LTE technology, they're investing a lot of money in it. If you moved to another carrier, you wouldn't get as good service. However the fixed line internet in Australia is nowhere near as good, as other commenters have said. Also, mobile data is expensive here, especially with Telstra (best network, so they charge more). You get 10GB on a $120/month plan with an iPhone 7 (unlimited talk and text). And when you go over the 10GB, it doesn't throttle your speed, you get charged at a $10/GB rate.

Usually this updated technology is deployed in the rest of the world after the USA. So why don't you just upgrade the technology? Well, upgrading usually costs more money, and technology 1.0 tends to be good enough.

The US government (FCC) Is in charge of dividing up the available spectrum via auctions. 5MHZ of additional spectrum can cost billions of dollars per market (geographic area). That's the reason he carriers are always trying to merge or buy each other out. It isn't the towers, customers, or equipment. It's the spectrum. The carrier with the most bandwidth owns the speed and thus owns the customers. It's a vicious game.\",\n",
